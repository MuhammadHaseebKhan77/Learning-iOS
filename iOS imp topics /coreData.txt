Q) Core Data 

A) Core data is a framework provided by apple for storing, retrieving, and managing data in your app in a super-efficient way. It helps iOS and macOS developers manage their app's data effortlessly. core data operates on memory (data needs to be loaded from disk to memory)



Difference between core data and user defaults 

A).   Core Data:

1- Complex Data Models: Core Data is designed for managing complex data models with relationships between entities. It's ideal for apps that need to store and manage structured data, such as database-driven applications.

2- Performance: It's optimized for handling large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for applications with extensive data storage requirements.

3- Offline Support: Core Data persists data on the device's disk, allowing users to access their data even when the app is offline or the device is restarted.

4- Learning Curve: Using Core Data requires understanding its concepts like managed object contexts, entities, and relationships. While it offers powerful features, it may have a steeper learning curve for beginners.


UserDefaults:

1- Simple Key-Value Storage: UserDefaults provides a simple key-value storage mechanism for storing small amounts of data, such as user preferences, settings, and other simple data types.

2- Performance: It's lightweight and suitable for storing small amounts of data with minimal impact on performance. However, it's not optimized for handling large datasets or complex data structures.

3- Offline Support: UserDefaults stores data locally on the device's disk, making it accessible even when the app is closed or restarted. However, it's not suitable for scenarios where extensive offline support is required.

4- Ease of Use: UserDefaults is straightforward and easy to use, making it suitable for basic data storage needs. It doesn't require a deep understanding of complex concepts, making it accessible to beginners.


Summary:
Core Data is a powerful framework for managing complex data models and supporting large datasets. It's suitable for database-driven applications that require extensive data storage and offline support.
UserDefaults is a lightweight mechanism for storing small amounts of simple data, such as user preferences and settings. It's easy to use and suitable for basic data storage needs. However, it's not designed for handling complex data structures or extensive offline support.
